I’m a third-year student at Northeastern University studying computer science. I enjoyed working with the brilliant people at the MITRE Corporation and RSA Security and am now a full-stack software engineer at Alignable.


Recently, I’ve been pouring my time into Sandbox, a student-led software consultancy for academia that I founded. As we grow from three co-founders to twenty-five members in less than a year, I've had a lot of fun (and stress) scaling up the organization, but the opportunity to see software development from a management perspective has been eye opening.


Outside of programming, my interests include photography, Vulfpeck, and breakfast.
