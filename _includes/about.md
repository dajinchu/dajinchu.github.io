I’m a third-year student at Northeastern University studying computer science, driven by solving complex problems and building useful software with large scale impacts. I'm currently a Co-Op as a full-stack software engineer at Alignable.


On the side, I’ve been spending a lot of my time as Technical Director of Sandbox, a software consulting club with 25 members building custom software for researchers. It has been an amazing combination of interesting software problems, high-impact work, and a foray into managing organizations.


Outside of programming, my interests include photography, Vulfpeck, and breakfast.
