I’m a third-year student at Northeastern University studying computer science. I enjoyed working with the brilliant people at the MITRE Corporation and RSA Security and am now working as a full-stack software engineer at Alignable.


My favorite projects are always when I work with people to develop their ideas into delightful, robust prototypes and products.


Recently I’ve been focusing on full-stack development, creating custom software for researchers, and trying to teach myself Rust. Outside of programming, my interests include photography, quadcopters, and breakfast.
