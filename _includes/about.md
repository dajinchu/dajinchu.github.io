I'm a first year computer science student at Northeastern University, and I expect to graduate in 2021. I enjoyed working as a software engineering intern at the MITRE Corporation and at RSA Security for several years, and I will be pursuing further experience through Northeastern's
co-op program and my own personal projects.


I chose to become an engineer because it's a practical way to make people's lives better, and I love seeing the difference that I can make for others, as well as the technical challenges of problem solving.


Recently I've been focusing on web development, streamlining software for psychology research, and designing programming languages. Outside of programming, my interests include photography, quadcopters, Kanye West, and breakfast.
