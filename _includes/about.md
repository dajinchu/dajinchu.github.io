I'm a second-year undergraduate studying computer science at Northeastern University, expecting to graduate in 2021. 
I enjoyed working with the brilliant people at the MITRE Corporation and RSA Security and am excited to co-op at Alignable in the fall of 2019!


I chose engineering because it's a practical way to make people's lives better, and I love seeing the difference that I can make for others, as well as the technical challenges of problem solving.
My favorite projects are always when I work with people to develop their ideas into delightful, robust prototypes and products.


Recently I've been focusing on full-stack development, creating custom software for researchers, and trying to teach myself Rust. 
Outside of programming, my interests include photography, quadcopters, Jay-Z, and breakfast.
