I'm a computer science student at Northeastern University expecting to graduate in 2021. 
I enjoyed working with the brilliant people at the MITRE Corporation and RSA Security and am pursuing similar experiences through internships, research, and personal projects.


I chose to become an engineer because it's a practical way to make people's lives better, and I love seeing the difference that I can make for others, as well as the technical challenges of problem solving.
My favorite projects are always when I work with people to develop their ideas into delightful, robust prototypes and products.


Recently I've been focusing on web development, streamlining software for psychology research, and designing programming languages. 
Outside of programming, my interests include photography, quadcopters, Jay-Z, and breakfast.
