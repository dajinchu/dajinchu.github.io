        I worked as a software engineer to provide our sales engineers with the tools to sell more effectively. My
        primary project was to develop an enterprise-wide search system to overhaul how employees find what they need. I
        designed a system that crawls all of our existing sites and servers, indexes all documents, and exposes a single
        faceted search to find any internal resource. I also led a team of three interns to build a portable system to
        run product demos across a variety of screen configurations at conferences, trade show floors, and executive
        briefing centers across the world.

        I worked in GPS modernization, a project funded by the U.S. Air Force to provide tools to enable the next
        generation of GPS satellites and protocols. I lead the development of an interactive map to monitor the health
        of the GPS satellite constellation in real time and reduced the page load time of one of our sites to less than
        200ms and shrank page size by an order of magnitude. I also revamped the UI and performance for CNVRG, an
        exploration and visualization tool for GPS signal data.
