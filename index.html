                <p>
                    I'm a first year computer science student at Northeastern University, and I expect to graduate in 2021. 
                    I've enjoyed working as a software engineering intern at the MITRE Corporation for several years, and I will be pursuing further experience through Northeastern's co-op program and my own personal projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose to become an engineer because it's a concrete way to make people's lives better. I love seeing the difference that I can make for others, as well as the technical challenges of problem solving. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recently I've been focusing on web development, streamlining software for psychology research, and designing programming languages. Outside of programming, my interests include photography, quadcopters, Kanye West, and breakfast.
